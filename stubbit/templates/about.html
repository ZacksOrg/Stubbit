            <h2>What Is Stubbit?</h2>
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                Introducing Stubbit: the revolutionizing website application that uniquely blends bug tracker software and community communication software into a transparent, inter-organization request application.
                Stubbit hopes to not only replace the current bug tracking systems within organizations, but also the countless emails that are sent back and forth detailing requests like issues, bugs, improvements, and more–
                these types of communication items are a frequent pattern in every business and can be organized in a powerful way using Stubbit.
            </p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="pic-column">
                    <img class="stubbit-pics" src="{% static 'images/CreateStub.png' %}" style="width: 766px; height: 769px;" />
                </div>
                <div class="pic-column">
                    <img class="stubbit-pics" src="{% static 'images/StubPic.png' %}" style="position: relative; left: -24px; width: 920px; height: 241px;"/>
                </div>
                </div>
                <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                    Stubbit allows each user to create stubs for the other users in an organization–which work similar to
                    support tickets–regardless of whether or not he/she is a developer for the organization.
                    Users will be able to view issued and received stubs, update stubs with important metadata
                    such as estimated completion time, and complete stubs. The web application hopes to redesign
                    the processes that organization members follow to create requests with each other.
                    Typically, outside of other issue tracking/bug tracking software, an email is sent to a coworker/colleague
                    containing some sort of request. These requests can get lost in the recipient’s inbox,
                    become forgotten about, and easily become cluttered. Many individuals in the industry take these
                    emails and then place them into a self-organized document that helps them to stay on top of the different
                    items they need to work on for everyone else. Stubbit’s pioneering design handles all of this in an
                    structured manner. For the individuals like application developers and IT that maintain an application
                    and therefore use support tickets in place of these emails, Stubbit provides a better solution. These
                    traditional support tickets track bugs and systematically create a workflow for IT/development to work
                    on bugs to the system–but what about other requests like new features, upgrades, system improvements,
                    new menu items? Additionally, what about other data like how long the issue will take to fix or which issue
                    is being worked on by a given developer? Stubbit answers these questions.
